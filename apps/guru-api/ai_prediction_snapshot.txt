On this sacred Tritiya of the Krishna Paksha, under the guiding star of Purva Phalguni, the wheel of Time turns with a specific intention. The waning phase of the Moon invites introspection and reflection, while the soft and creative nature of Purva Phalguni encourages a focus on beauty and harmony. Today is Wednesday, ruled by Mercury, which supports intellectual activities and communication.

Jupiter, the Mahadasha Lord, currently transits Gemini (Mithuna) in your 6th house with 2 bindus, indicating a moderate level of support. As Jupiter is retrograde, there is an intensified focus on revisiting past duties and responsibilities, especially in the realm of service and health. This transit brings an opportunity to resolve unfinished business and address conflicts with wisdom.

Venus, the Antardasha Lord, transits Capricorn (Makara) in your 1st house, holding 0 bindus, signifying stress and the need for effort in matters of self-expression and personal charm. The lack of bindus suggests that harmony in personal relationships might require additional patience and understanding today.

The Moon transits Leo (Simha) in your 8th house, with 0 bindus, signifying a day of emotional intensity and potential transformation. The lack of comfort indicates that inner work and facing hidden fears can be challenging but ultimately rewarding. Do not initiate major ventures today.

Mercury, the Day Lord, transits Aquarius (Kumbha) in your 1st house, bringing a focus to intellect and communication. With 0 bindus, there is a need to be cautious in speech and interactions, ensuring clarity and precision to avoid misunderstandings.

Saturn transits Pisces (Meena) in your 2nd house with 0 bindus, suggesting financial discipline and restraint in speech. The influence of Saturn calls for responsibility and long-term planning in matters of wealth.

In light of these cosmic influences, focus on resolving past issues and nurturing inner transformation. Avoid initiating new projects and be mindful in communication. Embrace the discipline of Saturn to plan wisely for the future. Remember the Gita's teaching: "Perform your duty without attachment to results." As the classical maxim advises, "Patience is the companion of wisdom."
